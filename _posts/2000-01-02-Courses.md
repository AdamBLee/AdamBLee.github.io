<!-- Course Description -->
### This class is a fun introduction to computing and coding. Students will learn about what a computer is, and how to write a program.  Students will be able to share what they've learned about variables, loops, functions, and other fundamentals by coding with the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/){:target="_blank"}.

# Intro to robotics class -- Coming soon<br/>
### This class is a very interactive and hands on introduction to the world of robotics.  Using both the BBC micro:bit and arduino as a base, students will learn how to use sensors and servos to bring a robot to life.  <br><br><br>

# Tools for learning to code
### One of the main tools we use to teach the basics of code is [Microsoft Makecode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about){:target="_blank"}. Microsoft Makecode is a free platform for coding which features an easy to use visual programming language, as well as simulators to be able to run the code and see the output for your code.  

<!--Alright, you've got a clean copy and are ready to push some schmancy pages for the world to ogle at.

- Edit `_config.yml` to change your title, keywords, and description.
- Create a new file in `_posts/` called `2014-01-01-intro.md`
  Edit it, and add:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
---
title: "home"
bg: white     #defined in _config.yml, can use html color like '#010101'
color: black  #text color
style: center
---

# Example headline!
and so on..
{% endhighlight %}

- Create a second post called `2014-01-02-art.md` with an divider image this time:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
---
title: "Art"
bg: turquoise  #defined in _config.yml, can use html color like '#0fbfcf'
color: white   #text color
fa-icon: paint-brush
---

#### A new section- oh the humanity!
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** That part `fa-icon: paint-brush` will use a font-awesome icon of [paint-brush](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/paint-brush/). You can use any icon from this [font-awesome icon directory](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).

- install Jekyll with `sudo gem install github-pages`
- run `jekyll serve -w`
  - visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see a live locally served preview.
- Push changes and see them live!




## **Changing your colors**
{: style="margin-top:100px;"}

- In each post file you can define `bg: mycolor` and `color: myothercolor` to change the background and text colors for that section.
- **mycolor** can be a quoted html color like `'#0fbfcf'` or a key to a special color defined in **_config.yml** under 'colors'.
  - **Note:** Changes to _config.yml require a manual restart to your local server with `^C` and `jekyll serve -w`.

Nifty, right!
