## Who am I?
 My name is Adam Lee, I've been a professional software developer since 2015, and I love space and technology since I was a kid.  I had many amazing experiences with computers and tech that have stuck with me throughout my life.  They were experiences with science, tech, and computers that were fun, engaging, and opened up my imagination to science and technology.  
 When I was in college I was initially pursuing a medical path, but then my plans changed.  I remembered all the experiences with science and technology that I had as a kid.  Those experiences helped me make the choice to change my plans and become a programmer.
 I hope to help kids of all ages to have experiences with science and technology like I did that will capture their imagination and give them skills that they can use in the future.
